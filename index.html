    <h2 id="gitlab-background">GitLab Background</h2>
    <p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, founded in 2014, quickly emerged as a frontrunner in the DevOps 
        toolchain, offering a single application for the entire software development lifecycle. From project planning and 
        source code management to CI/CD, monitoring, and security, GitLab has provided comprehensive solutions that 
        streamline productivity and foster a collaborative environment for software development teams. Its ability to 
        support both the development and operations side of projects makes it particularly appealing for managing machine 
        learning (ML) projects, which inherently require cross-disciplinary collaboration between software engineers and 
        data scientists.</p>

    <h2 id="gitlab-ml-ops">GitLab ML Ops</h2>
    <p>MLOps, a compound of machine learning and operations, aims to unify ML system development and ML system deployment. 
        The goal of MLOPs is to shorten the lifecycle of deploying machine learning models and provide continuous feedback between models 
        and development to ensure models are valuable and efficient. GitLab naturally facilitates MLOps through integrated CI/CD 
        pipelines, enabling automated model testing, deployment, and monitoring, but they saw an opportunity to close the gap between 
        data scientist and software developers...</p>

    <p>This automation is not only crucial for the rapid iteration 
        of ML projects but also ensures models are up-to-date and perform as expected in production environments. 
        Furthermore, GitLab's issue tracking and project management tools allow for seamless integration of MLOps tasks 
        with the broader objectives of the development project, ensuring that ML models evolve in alignment with software 
        development and business needs.Because of GitLab's value proposistion to be a central platform for development, they 
        have started BETA testing MLOps tools which integrate with GitLab's interface.</p>

    <h3 id="gitlab-experiments-overview">Overview</h3>

    <p>Experimentation is at the heart of machine learning. GitLab supports this through integrated tracking and management of experiments, facilitating the systematic exploration of model architectures, hyperparameters, and data processing techniques. By leveraging GitLab's CI/CD pipelines for ML workflows, teams can automate the execution of experiments, record results, and ensure reproducibility. This capability is enhanced by GitLab's support for Docker containers, which can encapsulate experiment environments to ensure consistency across different stages of development and deployment. Additionally, GitLab's Artifacts and Environments features allow for the storage of experiment outputs and the easy rollback to previous versions of models, making experiment management more straightforward and efficient.</p>

    <h3>How to Format Code</h3>
    <p>Displaying code within your blog can be a challenge, but it's essential for technical topics. Here's how you can add a code snippet:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        <pre><code>// Example JavaScript function
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The above example shows a simple JavaScript function. Notice how we use the <code>pre</code> and <code>code</code> tags for proper formatting.</p>
